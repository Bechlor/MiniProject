    <p class="para">Shimla derives its name from Shyamala Devi, an incarnation of the goddess Kali, whose temple existed in the dense
    forest covering the Jakhu Hill in the early 19th century. Shimla is the capital of Himachal Pradesh and was also the
    summer capital in pre-Independence India. Covering an area of 25 sq km at a height of 7,238 ft, Shimla is surrounded
    by pine, deodar and oak forests. Its well developed amenities, easy reach and various tourist attractions make it
    one of India’s most popular hill stations.</p> <br><br>

    <P class="para">Shimla is an excellent base for treks in the surrounding hills or beyond, rafting and trout fishing at Tattapani 51
    km from Shimla and golf at the 9-hole golf course at Naldehra. In winter, there is skiing at Kufri and Narkanda from
    January to mid-March. You can also go shopping at some of Shimla’s most lively and colorful markets. You can
    entertain yourself in a cultural or a dramatic performance or take pleasure in a sporting activity. A wide range of
    activities and attractions will surely keep you occupied all the time.</P>

    <h3 class="headings">BEST TIME TO VISIT</h3>
    <p class="para">The best time to visit Shimla is during May to June and December to January when romance and beauty are baked into
    every inch of the soil here. Clear blue skies in summer, sprinkles of powdery snow in the winter, the spicy and
    earthy scent carried by pines, firs, cedars and oak trees.</P></div>
