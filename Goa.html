    beaches, the markets, the parties and the natural beauty of this marvelous destination on the west coast of India is
    what mesmerizes everyone. Goa became part of the hippie trail during the ’70s. Anjuna was the destination everyone

    considered ideal for beach holidays, those in south Goa are known for their scenic splendor. Be it the beautiful

    <p class="para">The peak season to visit Goa starts mid November and lasts till mid February. Though the months from June to
    September aren’t exactly ‘peak’ season, a visit to Goa during these months is highly recommended because this is
    when you see a very different side to this ‘party capital of India’.</p></div>
