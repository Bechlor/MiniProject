    <h3 class="headings">WHAT TO KNOW</h3>

    <p class="para">One of the most revered temple destinations of India, Kedarnath town is nestled in the mighty Garhwal Himalayas. The
    town, built around the revered Kedarnath temple, is located at an altitude of 3,580 m, near Chorabari glacier, which
    is the source of the Mandakini river.</p><br><br>

    <p class="para">Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the ancient temple has exquisite architecture and is built of extremely large but evenly
    shaped grey stone slabs. A conical rock formation inside the temple is
    worshipped as Lord Shiva in his “Sadashiva” form.</p><br><br>

    <p class="para">The Kedarnath temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, is a part of Char Dham pilgrimage circuit, and is one of the 12
    Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva in India. Behind the Kedarnath temple,
    stand the Kedarnath peak, Kedar Dome and other Himalayan peaks.</p><br><br>

    <p class="para">The historical name of this region is "Kedar Khand" and legend says, the Pandavas from the epic Mahabharata, after
    having defeated the Kauravas, felt guilty of having killed so many people and sought the blessings of Lord Shiva for
    redemption. The Lord eluded them repeatedly and took refuge at Kedarnath in the form of a bull.</p><br><br>

    <p class="para">The Lord dived into the ground, leaving his hump on the surface at Kedarnath. The remaining portions of Lord Shiva
    appeared at four other places and are worshipped there as his manifestations. The arms of the Lord appeared at
    Tungnath, the face at Rudranath, the belly at Madmaheshwar and his locks (hair) at Kalpeshwar. The Kedarnath and
    four above mentioned
    shrines make the revered Panch Kedar pilgrimage circuit.</p>
